## Project Task Description
* Enter two decimal non-symbol numbers (â‰¤65535) on the keyboard and calculate the multiplication of the two numbers. product,The results are output in decimal, hexadecimal, and binary, respectively.
* E.g: When you input number 12345 and 65535,you can see this on the screen:
